Simple Python Sensor Library
============================

This is a small and simple library to collect data using Sensirion sensors with
Python. Currently the following sensor chips are supported:

* SHT3x (temperature and humidity)
* SF04 (flow and differential pressure chip) used in the following products:
   * SDP6xx Series
   * SFM4xxx Series
   * SLx Series
   * Lx Series
   * LPG Series
* SF05 (flow and differential pressure chip) used in the following products:
   * SFM3xxx Series

Library
-------
The library functions are located in the file sensirion_sensors.py.  The
different functions and classes are documented in the source code.

Examples
--------
The library comes with three examples that show different ways to use the library:

1.  sync_example.py

    Command line tool that reads all sensors synchronously with the same sampling
    frequency. The data can either be plotted to the console or stored in a file.

2.  async_example.py

    Command line script that reads every sensor asynchronously with an individual
    sampling frequency.

3.  streaming_example.py

    An example script that streams all sensor data to a local MQTT broker.
    The format of the MQTT payload is JSON, an example for an SHT  sensor is
    included below. Timestamps are in seconds since 1970.

        {
            "timestamp": 1441799806.62,
            "values": [ 24.35, 53.21 ],
            "units": [ "Â°C", "%" ]
        }

4.  streaming_client.py and streaming_plot_client.py

    These scripts demonstrates how to connect to a remote broker and subscribe to sensor data.
    The streaming_client.py script simply prints all values to the console.
    The streaming_plot_client.py script opens up a window using Qt and shows live plots of all
    sensor values that are streamed.
